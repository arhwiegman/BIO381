## Why learn to manipulate text in a computer program?

- Humans communicate and organize systems with symbols
- Most computer programs are written with simple text
- Most computers read like humans do, left to write, top to bottom. 
- If you can algorithmically manipulate a line of text you can automate just about anything!
- ... or just free up your work day.

## Lesson Objective: 

**Use regular expressions (REGEX) with `stringr` to automate text searches and execute computer commands**

## Exercise 1: `stringr` REGEX practice

**OBJECTIVES:**
Review the stringr cheatsheet
Practice using `stringr` by manipulating a list of files in the working directory

```{R}
# `stringr` practice using files in the working directory
# Adrian Wiegman
# 20180418

#Load Packages----------
library(stringr)

#Manage Directories-----------
# return a character string with the path of the working directory
path = getwd()
# sets the working directory to path specified in character string
newfolder = 'stringr_demo'
dir.create(newfolder)
#note dir.create() makes a new folder
setwd(paste(path,newfolder,sep="/")
# returns 
myDir <- dir() 

#
allFiles <- str_view_all()
  
myFiles <-  str_extract_all(

allFolders <- str_view_all()

myFolder <- str_extract_all(

file.copy(from=filestocopy, to=newfolder, overwrite = recursive, recursive = FALSE,
          copy.mode = TRUE, copy.date = FALSE)
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10299712/copying-list-of-files-from-one-folder-to-other-in-r
file.remove(filestocopy)
```




**Note on `regex` with R:**

R uses different REGEX commands than most programs, for example there is no NOT escape character. 


## Exercise 2: Manipulating Copious Data 

**Objectives**

- Batch Read xlsx files into R
- Remove special characters and unwanted data
- Read text extract data.frame
- Save new file as csv


```{R}
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(stringr)

## Exercise 3: 'Web Sraping' (searching through html)

**OBJECTIVES:**

- Go to a website
- Inspect the structure of an html file 
- Determine the data you want 
- Use `stringr` to extract data

**Basic Text Structure of HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

	<body>
	
	  <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google</a>
	  
  </body>
  
</html>
```

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(scholar)
library(stringr)

#[insert functions and code]
```
